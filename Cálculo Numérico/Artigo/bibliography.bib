@article{Kokash2005,
abstract = {Nowadays computers are used to solve incredibly complex problems. But in order to manage with a problem we should develop an algorithm. Sometimes the human brain is not able to accomplish this task. Moreover, exact algorithms might need centuries to manage with formidable challenges. In such cases heuristic algorithms that find ap- proximate solutions but have acceptable time and space complexity play indispensable role. In this paper heuristics, their areas of application and the basic underlying ideas are surveyed. We also describe in more detail some modern heuristic techniques, namely Evolutionary Algorithms and Support Vector Machines.},

abstract = "Extreme variation in the meaning of the term “species” throughout the history of biology has often frustrated attempts of historians, philosophers and biologists to communicate with one another about the transition in biological thinking from the static species concept to the modern notion of evolving species. The most important change which has underlain all the other fluctuations in the meaning of the word “species” is the change from it denoting such metaphysical entities as essences, Forms or Natures to denoting classes of individual organisms. Several authors have taken notice of the role of metaphysics in the work of particular biologists. An attempt will be made in this paper to present a systematic investigation of the role which metaphysics has played in the work of representative biologists throughout the history of biology, especially as it relates to their species concepts.",
