@article{Kokash2005,
abstract = {Nowadays computers are used to solve incredibly complex problems. But in order to manage with a problem we should develop an algorithm. Sometimes the human brain is not able to accomplish this task. Moreover, exact algorithms might need centuries to manage with formidable challenges. In such cases heuristic algorithms that find ap- proximate solutions but have acceptable time and space complexity play indispensable role. In this paper heuristics, their areas of application and the basic underlying ideas are surveyed. We also describe in more detail some modern heuristic techniques, namely Evolutionary Algorithms and Support Vector Machines.},
